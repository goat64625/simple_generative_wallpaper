This script just creates a image with two colors in the form of a checker board pattern.

If you want a different color patten creat a .png of 1x1 pixel and in the pattern.py file change the 15th line from "fg1.png" to your new image name (1x1 pixel).


If you want a bigger image change the canvas size in line 4. You can also change the background color in the same line.

***This may take 2-3 minutes.
