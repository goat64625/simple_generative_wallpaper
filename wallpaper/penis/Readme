This script just pastes a transparent png all around a background in this case tiny male genitalia in a red background.

The placing of the png is "random" and is also rotated at random angles.

If you want any other png to repalce the peni.png with any other image with same name (peni.png).

If you want to change the number of png pasted on the foreground open main.py and change the while loop condition i.e change 1600 to a greater or smaller number.

If you want a bigger image change the canvas size in line 4. You can also change the background color in the same line.
